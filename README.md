# ChessVR
(Deprecated) WebVR Chess with speech recognition from 2019 developed by Lars M Bek & Ida M Jensen
The WebVR from https://webvr.info/ is Deprecated. It is instead replaced with webxr which can be found here https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/ 

As of 2022 i haven't tried webxr yet, but i'm up for developing if i get sponsored.
